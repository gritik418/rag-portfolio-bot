Role:
Full Stack Developer / System Architect

Overview:
Trackr is a scalable task management SaaS platform inspired by Jira. It enables organizations to manage work through a structured hierarchy: Organization → Workspace → Project → Task.

The system supports advanced Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), background job processing, media uploads, and scalable architecture design.

Core Hierarchy Structure:
- Organization
    - Workspace
        - Project
            - Task

Tech Stack:

Frontend:
- Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

Backend:
- NestJS (Modular architecture)
- PostgreSQL
- Prisma ORM
- Redis
- BullMQ (job queue)

Infrastructure & Services:
- Cloudinary (file uploads)
- JWT Authentication
- Redis-based caching
- Background job processing

Key Features:

1. Multi-Tenant Architecture
   - Organizations isolate data
   - Workspace-level separation
   - Project-based task grouping

2. Advanced RBAC System
   - Org-level roles
   - Workspace-level permissions
   - Project-level access control
   - Middleware-based permission guards

3. Task Management System
   - Create, update, delete tasks
   - Assign users
   - Priority & status management
   - Deadline tracking
   - Attachment uploads via Cloudinary

4. Background Processing
   - BullMQ for async task handling
   - Email notifications (extendable)
   - Scheduled task reminders
   - Queue retry strategies

5. Redis Integration
   - Caching frequently accessed data
   - Session handling optimization
   - Reduced DB load

6. Secure Authentication
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Protected routes
   - Permission-based route guards

Database Design:

- Organizations table
- Workspaces table
- Projects table
- Tasks table
- Users table
- Roles table
- Permissions table
- Many-to-many relationship modeling

Engineering Highlights:

- Designed complex relational schema with Prisma
- Implemented hierarchical RBAC with guard-based protection
- Separated modules by domain (auth, org, workspace, project, task)
- Optimized heavy queries using indexing
- Built scalable job queue system using BullMQ + Redis
- Designed multi-tenant isolation strategy

Challenges Solved:

- Designing flexible RBAC without role explosion
- Managing hierarchical permission inheritance
- Avoiding N+1 query issues
- Handling concurrent task updates
- Queue failure handling & retry logic

Scalability Considerations:

- Modular NestJS architecture
- Redis caching layer
- Queue-based async processing
- Ready for horizontal scaling
- Easily extendable for analytics & reporting

Future Expansion Possibilities:

- Activity logs
- Audit trail
- WebSocket-based real-time updates
- Gantt chart visualization
- Kanban board view
- Organization billing & subscription model

Impact:

- Demonstrates enterprise SaaS architecture capability
- Showcases RBAC, multi-tenancy, and queue system design
- Production-ready backend structure
